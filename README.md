# Fox_Project WIP
A small classification project using PyTorch and CNN. Model was trained ~3000 pictures of foxes and not including a fox (birds, cats, dogs etc) gathered from Keggle datasets and across Internet.
It is still a WIP as it needs some fine-tuning and proper displays of statistical meausers.
Right now model has accuracy of 78% and detects a fox accuretly on an image from r/Foxes on Reddit.
